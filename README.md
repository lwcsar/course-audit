# Grad Audit

This is a standalone application designed to take data from Renweb and a database of school courses and provide a report of missing courses required to graduate from high school.

The application is designed in partnership with computer science students and a sponsoring teacher to serve the school in a tangible way by reducing the workload of the staff.
